# Reinforcement-Learning-Project
LUNAR LANDER CONTINUOUS WITH DDPG AND SAC

For this project I wanted to explore two specific areas of Reinforcement Learning, namely, environments with continuous action space and agents that are powerful enough to solve them. For this specific project, I chose to work with the environment ‘Lunar Lander Continuous -version 2.0’ from Open AI gym. The algorithms that I explored for the task of solving this environment are Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Soft Actor Critic (SAC). In the report titled " Reinforcement Learning-Final Project Report.pdf", I will give a brief background of continuous state space environments in general and Lunar Lander Continuous in particular. The different sections will explain the algorithm and architecture of DDPG and SAC, with reference to the papers they were published in.
